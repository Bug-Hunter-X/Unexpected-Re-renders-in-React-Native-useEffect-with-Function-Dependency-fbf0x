This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a dependency array that includes a function.  The function may not be properly compared during dependency checks, leading to unexpected re-renders.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    // ...fetch data...
  };
  fetchData();
}, [fetchData]); // Incorrect dependency
```

The problem lies in `[fetchData]`.  Each render creates a new function instance, triggering `useEffect` unnecessarily.
